**1.What is Digital Electronics?**

Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with systems and devices that use digital signals, which are discrete representations of data, 
typically using binary code (0s and 1s).


**2.Applications of Digital Electronics?**

1.Computing

2.Communication

3.Control Systems

4.Home Appliances

5.Medical Devices

6.Automotive



**3.Digital vs Analog signals?**

Analog Signals:

Continuous:

They can take on any value within a range, unlike digital signals which are discrete.

Examples:

Sound waves, voltage fluctuations, radio waves, and the hands of a clock. 

High Fidelity:
They can reproduce the original information with high fidelity, but may not be as robust over long distances. 

Digital Signals:

Discrete:

They represent information using a limited set of values, typically binary code (0s and 1s). 
Examples:

Digital clocks, computers, and most modern communication systems. 
Robust to Noise:

Digital signals are more resilient to noise because they can be easily regenerated. 

**4.Logic Levels?**

In digital electronics, logic levels represent the two states, typically 0 and 1, of a digital signal, often corresponding to a voltage level. These levels are crucial for how digital circuits interpret and process information.

Binary Representation:

Logic levels are used to represent binary data, where 0 and 1 are the fundamental states. 
Voltage Levels:

In many digital systems, a low voltage represents a 0 (logic low), and a high voltage represents a 1 (logic high).

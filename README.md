**What is Digital Electronics?**

Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with systems and devices that use digital signals, which are discrete representations of data, 
typically using binary code (0s and 1s).


**Applications of Digital Electronics?**

Computing

Communication

Control Systems

Home Appliances

Medical Devices

Automotive 

**Digital vs Analog signals?**

| **Analog** | **Digital** 
|------------|------------|
|A continuous wave that represents data|A discrete signal that represents data in binary form (0s and 1s)|
|Requires less bandwid from transmission| Request more bandwidth due to discrete data encoding|
|Less expensive to produce and transmit| More expensive due to advanced technology and processing requirements|
|Less flexible. order to modify or enhance| Highly flexible. easy to modify,compress, or enhance|
|Analog signal use more power| Digital signal useless power|
|Analog signal easily affected by the noise| Digital signal are stable and less prone to noise|
|Components like resistors,Capacitors, Inductors,Diodes are used in analog circuits.| Components like transistors, logic gates,and microcontrollers are used in digital circuits.|


**Logic Levels?**

In digital electronics, logic levels represent the two states, typically 0 and 1, of a digital signal, often corresponding to a voltage level. These levels are crucial for how digital circuits interpret and process information.

Binary Representation:

Logic levels are used to represent binary data, where 0 and 1 are the fundamental states. 
Voltage Levels:

In many digital systems, a low voltage represents a 0 (logic low), and a high voltage represents a 1 (logic high).
